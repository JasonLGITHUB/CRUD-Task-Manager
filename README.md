# CRUD-Task-Manager with Node.js,HBS, Mongodb
Add frontend forms for Authenticate,  Create, Read, Update and Delete operation.  
Backend is based on Task-Manager.
Auth, Creat, Read, Delete and Login/logout are working, I need to implement the Update/Patch operation.  
Update/Patch has been implemented after modified user_me_patch.hbs form and changed router.patch(...) to router.post (....)
